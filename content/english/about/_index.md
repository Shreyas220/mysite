Hey there, I'm Shreyas Mishra. I'm a software engineer from who loves building reliable and scalable systems. 
Right now, I'm working at E6data on some pretty cool projects like creating a streaming ingestion for data lakeouse.

I started my journey by contribution to cncf projects like meshery and kubearmor. Later became a mentor of the project even mentored in GSoc for kubearmor
